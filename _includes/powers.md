    As far as I can tell, there are two choices for these links: wowdb.com and
    wowhead.com. Pick your poison.

    * wowdb.com is owned by curse -> twitch -> amazon.com
    * wowhead.com is owned by zam -> who knows how many companies -> tencent

    So either way, you're getting tracked heavily. Indeed both includes trigger
    privacy badger.

    I guess I'm going with wowdb, because I'd rather have an american company tracking me.
