The threat warnings are disabled by default for tanks, however, if you're a warrior, the detection for a tank is whether or not you're in _Defensive Stance_. If you happen to be a low-level warrior, you won't have _Defensive Stance_, so I made a new profile called "low-level tank" and disabled the high-threat warnings in that profile.
