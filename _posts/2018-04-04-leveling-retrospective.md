title: Leveling Retrospective
---
Cordolvar has advanced to level 110, so it's time to look back over this experiment and see if anything has been learned.

## Evaluation Points

In my [first post]({% link _posts/2018-01-28-introduction.md %}), I listed a number of questions I wanted to answer:

Is the performance of easily purchased strength plate heirlooms adequate?
: *Yes.* I've solicited feedback from a handful of the random healers I grouped with, and none of them indicated that I was in any way more difficult to heal than anyone else. I joined a group-in-progress once wherein the healer commented that I was much less squishy than the tank that had previously been in the group.

I did die more than I expected, however I can't recall any deaths being particularly due to gearing. My feeling is that the vast majority of deaths were caused by lack of attention from players[^1].

What I define as easily purchased is covered in detail in my [Classic Dungeon Retrospective]({% link _posts/2018-02-22-retrospective.md %}).

Which UI modifications help the most, and why?
: No changes here since [the last retrospective]({% link _posts/2018-02-22-retrospective.md %}), but I'll reprint what I wrote there for convenience:

  * *Weak Auras*<br/>
     My [Shield Slam Weak Aura]({% link _ui_mods/weak-auras.md %}) is definitely the most useful WA in in my setup. Using Shield Slam on cooldown is the best way to generate rage, and rage fuels everything else a warrior does.
  * *Bartender4*<br/>
     Arranging lots of powers on lots of bars that you can see when and where you want is a key part of any UI. Add in super easy keybinding setup and you have a winner.
  * *Pawn*<br/>
     Quickly knowing at a glance if anything is an upgrade is really nice. I could sit in game and debate whether having X amount of stat Y is better or worse than I amount of stat J, but really it just doesn't matter[^2], and Pawn takes the guesswork out of it all.

Does any of this even matter in 2018?
: *Minimally.* But it made the leveling process more fun for me.

Can good tanking practices make runs go more smoothly?
: *Yes.* This was a "Maybe" in the previous retrospective. Post Wrath of the Lich King, there were enough fights---both boss and trash---that were significantly easier with knowledge of the mechanics, that I felt like careful attention to positioning and timing provided noticeable improvements to the survival rate of the group, and contributed to faster, smoother runs.

Do you need to know fight mechanics at all?
: *Rarely.* This was "no" in the previous retrospective. The content encountered above level 80 saw a significant increase in the number of fights where knowing the mechanics helped. For me, this was a positive development. In most cases where you need to know the fights, someone in the group can explain what you need to do. If not, don't forget to check the in-game Adventure Guide, and I found [quickdungeon.com](https://quickdungeon.com/)  to be useful as well.

Will I ever learn my way around all these dungeons?
: *Yes, though maybe not in a single character.* No change here, although I think the proportion of non-linear dungeons went down a little in the content post level 60.

What was your favorite dungeon?
: *Blackrock Caverns.* Because I liked a number of the boss fights, particularly [Karsh Steelbender](https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/39698-karsh-steelbender).

What was your least favorite dungeon?
: *Maraudon.* Simply because I ran it so many times---it became very tiresome. This may have been bad luck with the random number generator.

## Random Notes

How long did the leveling process take?
: *Around nine weeks.* I averaged about two  hours per session, three to four sessions per week. There were weeks I went without playing at all, and other weeks where I managed a little time each day. I'm sure there are faster ways to level, but that wasn't my goal.

Did you run every dungeon available through the dungeon finder?
: *No, but I think I could have.* Cordolvar didn't run many dungeons in either Warlords of Draenor, or Legion. He also advanced a few levels via questing in Cataclysm, and therefore did fewer Cataclysm and Mists of Pandaria dungeons. I believe Cordolvar ran every Classic, Burning Crusade, and Wrath of the Lich King dungeon though. If I continued to level strictly through dungeons, I believe I would have run every dungeon at least once.

If I were to level another character via dungeons, I would run more, especially through Warlords of Draenor content, but if you run dungeons exclusively, then you miss the class hall and artifact weapon quests in Legion, which are pretty important, at least while Legion is current. I'm confident that when Battle for Azeroth (BfA) comes out, it will make sense to run Legion dungeons, but then quest through the-current BfA content.

What was Cordolvar's longest run of dungeons tanked without a death?
: *10* With an average of 2.5. I'm honestly surprised I died that much. I have a level 80 restoration druid that has run 57 dungeons and died only 18 times (including deaths outside of dungeons), so it seems that tanks might die more than healers, at least in this player's experience.

What were queue times like?
: *Very short.* A table seems to make sense here:

| Level Range                              | Average Queue Time (Estimated) | Notes                             |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Classic                                  | < 10 seconds                   |                                   |
| Burning Crusade & Wrath of the Lich King | around 60 seconds              | High variability                  |
| Cataclysm & Mists of Pandaria            | around 30 seconds              |                                   |
| Warlords of Draenor                      | < 10 seconds                   | Not enough samples for confidence |
| Legion                                   | < 10 seconds                   | Not enough samples for confidence|

These are all estimates based on what I remember, although I did pay attention to queue times. I find it interesting that the times seemed to spike during Cataclysm and Mists of Pandaria content. On those occasions, the group was always waiting for a healer, which isn't surprising.

## Conclusion

So there you have it. The results are underwhelming. There weren't any big surprises. If you're an experienced, attentive tank, congratulations, you're contributing to smoother runs for yourself and your group. If you're a new tank, or even a new player, go ahead and jump in there and give it a shot. Tanking is fun, and you don't need detailed knowledge of the mechanics to be successful. There are resources for the few occasions when you do need to know mechanics, and leveling via chaining dungeons is a great chance to practice positioning, aggro control, add pickup, and lots of other useful tanking skills.

## What's Next

I'll continue to prepare Cordolvar for casual raiding and mythic dungeons in Legion. I suspect that my posts here will be sporadic going forward, and they will function primarily as a notebook for my personal use.

I have a lengthy post in the works detailing my philosophy on UI design. I hope to publish that in the next week or two.

If you've read any of these blog posts, I hope you've enjoyed them. If you have any questions, please feel free to email me at the email or twitter links at the bottom of the page.

[^1]: Either healers not paying attention while DPSing, or some member of the group (possibly myself) pulling extra mobs by accident.

[^2]: In the end-game this could matter, but not while leveling.
