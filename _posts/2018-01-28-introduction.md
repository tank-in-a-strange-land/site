# What's This All About?

The purpose of this site is to organize a journal of my thoughts and experiences leveling a tank in World of Warcraft in 2018. I will be primarily running random dungeons with a bit of questing here and there.

## What I've Accomplished So Far

Over the past few days, I leveled an undead warrior (that I've named Cordolvar) up to level 15, and acquired plate heirlooms with haste bonuses. I chose haste because at the end game it seems haste is more important than crit. I don't know if that's true at my level, but it's the best guidance I have to go on. The general consensus is that so long as you have strength plate, the crit or haste distinction isn't very important.

Last night I headed into my first handful of dungeons. Overall, they were successful runs. I died once during a Ragefire Chasm run. Early in the dungeon, a pack of trash dropped me suddenly. I thought that perhaps I had <abbr title="Line of Sight">LOS</abbr>'d the healer, or stood in lava, but when I asked if I had dome something silly, the healer replied that it was a mis-click on his part that allowed me to die. At this level, I don't really have a lot of survivability cooldowns. I have Victory Rush, but it wasn't up (that I can remember). I don't normally keep potions on my characters when leveling, but I guess maybe I should from now on, at least until I get a few cooldowns I can rely on. It's possible that maybe I had my back turned to a mob I couldn't see, but I don't think so.

## Where I'm Going Next

Cordolvar is now level 20. I took a break and trained my riding skill and picked out a nice undead horse for him to ride. I did a few quests, and noticed that questing as <abbr title="protection">prot</abbr> at level 20 was definitely not killing mobs as fast as it was in the lead up to level 15.

I have a few new dungeons I'll be eligible for next time, so I'm going to try to read up a little about those, and take down a few notes about the bosses in Deadmines and RFC.

And in case I'm reading this later, apparently VC is an old abbreviation for Deadmines, so-named because the leader of the Defias Brotherhood was Edward Van Cleef, and this prevents confusion with the Dire Maul dungeon.
