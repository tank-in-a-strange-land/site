title: Done With Maraudon
---
Cordolvar completed a bunch of non-dungeon quests, out-leveling Maraudon (finally!) and then dove back into more dungeons.

## Progress Made

Cordolvar started off with a bunch of questing. I needed a break from Maraudon, plus I didn't have time to play when I wasn't going to be interrupted. It was fun to get out and see more of Azeroth. Cordolvar completed a bunch of quests near Undercity, including the Sludge Fields questline, and the Orkus questline, which I really enjoyed. The new level scaling added in patch 7.3.5 is great; I can run all the dungeons I want, then just pick up the quest I left off at. No need to run to a new area. I really like that.

Cordolvar also solo-killed [Yetimus](http://www.wowdb.com/quests/28485-yetimus-the-yeti-lord)[^2], though just barely.

After grabbing a few levels, I had more time for dungeons. First up was Razorfen Downs, which I enjoyed. I had no idea where I was going, but fortunately, the dungeon seemed to be very linear, with few questions of the "should I pull this pack or not?" variety.

Next Cordolvar joined a group in progress in Dire Maul: Capital Gardens. I'm pretty sure I've been in Capital Gardens on other characters, but I was still pretty lost. The party's hunter had their pet's growl turned on, which as a tank is very annoying (and dangerous on boss fights!)

Next was yet another group in progress, this time Stratholme. I didn't get any quests, and when we completed it, they all popped, so I hope I get into Stratholme again. I might have to manually queue for it.

After a break, I queued again, and entered Dire Maul: Gordok Commons. I had no idea which way to go. I found the trash fights here interesting, as there was a nice mix of spellcasters and melee, so it rewarded the smart use of interrupts. As the party snuck by a group, someone must not have been paying attention, and pulled it. I noticed, ran back, and gave aid, but the healer did not, so Cordolvar died. These kinds of deaths are very frustrating. I guess I should have either let the person that pulled the pack die, or kited the mobs back until I was in the healers face so I could get heals.

The Dire Maul party also had a hunter that did a lot of the dumbest pulls imaginable. They didn't misdirect to Cordolvar[^1], and they constantly picked the worst target to pull. I really should have just let the hunter tank anything they pulled. After this session, I can see why hunters have such a poor reputation.

Uldaman was next up. Another dungeon that I don't think I've ever been to. This party included a very impatient shaman. While no one died, the shaman's constant early pulls were very frustrating. I didn't enjoy this run at all as a result. I was constantly having to pick up randoms and re-group because of the shaman's antics.

## Random Notes

My overall mood from the recent runs is frustration. I'm frustrated with impatient party members, and hunter players in general.

I like Cordolvar's level 45 talent, [Renewed Fury][renewed-fury]. However I think I'm now casting [Ignore Pain][ignore-pain] more often, which if I'm not careful, leaves Cordolvar without enough rage to cast [Shield Block][shield-block], and I think that's negatively impacting rage generation.

* &#x1f44d; Got new boots.
* &#x1f44e; Cordolvar's death streak remains intact.
* &#x1f44e; Lots of unfinished quests in Dire Maul and Stratholme.
* &#x1f44d; Cordolvar has almost reached level 50.

### UI Modifications

My UI seems to be in a pretty good place. I still want to tweak how my Shield Block Weak Aura works, but I'm in no rush, as what I have now is fine.

#### Footnotes

[^1]:It's possible he or she was in survival spec, and therefore didn't have Misdirection, but I didn't check.
[^2]:Yetimus appeared as an elite of Cordolvar's level plus two.
