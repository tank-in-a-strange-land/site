title: The Quest Cleanup
---
Cordolvar ran through several dungeons, while being stunned, rooted, and ultimately killed. He did clear out a bunch of leftover quests though!

## Progress Made

First up was Blackrock Depths: Detention Center. Somehow I knew it wouldn't be as massive or fun of an undertaking as [the last time]({% link _posts/2018-02-14-epic-brd-run.md %}). I had my quickdungeon.com map out, and things went smoothly. I was ready for Lord Roccor this time!

Next was the Temple of Atalâ€™Hakkar, aka Sunken Temple. This was my first time tanking this dungeon, but I think I did alright. I got lost once, but had help from the rest of the party. I was pretty worried when our healer was a druid in Boomkin form, but aside from one close call, my health was never an issue, so kudos to you Boomkin healer.

Then came Dire Maul: Capital Gardens where Cordolvar died twice. His first death came at the hands of Illyanna Ravenoak. Both Cordolvar and the healer got stunned and died. Bad timing I guess. The rest of the party managed to crowd control her bear and kite her around long enough for Cordolvar to run back, so that was good on their part.

Later in the gardens, I once again underestimated how far one travels with [levitate](http://www.wowdb.com/spells/1706-levitate) and jumped right into Tendris Warpwood. Just when I thought we had recovered from my blunder, I got rooted for twelve seconds, during which two adds were spawned and started attacking me from behind. It didn't take long before I died and the party wiped. Perhaps better positioning would have helped? I don't know if those root spells[^1] are interruptible, or dispellable? I guess it's also an argument for tanking with your back to the wall? It can be really hard to see adds with your back to the wall and a huge tree in front of you though. Trade-offs I guess.

The last run for the evening was Uldaman. One of the DPS was in a hurry and led the way, but he did mostly let Cordolvar pull, which was appreciated. About halfway through the dungeon I guess he got tired and he stopped leading the way. So using the map, I guided us the rest of the way. We did the bosses in overall a very different order than the last time I had run this dungeon, but I guess that's fine.

Cordolvar had a bunch of quests from both Uldaman and Capital Gardens from runs he had previously joined in progress, so clearing those out felt good, and was enough to advance him to level 54. This added [Battle Cry][battle-cry] to his spellbook, with one more level to go until [Shield Wall][shield-wall] joins it there.

## Random Notes

Cordolvar got his first Epic loot! <a style="color: rgb(171, 72, 238)" href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/10847-dragons-call">Dragon's Call</a>, which he'll proudly wield until he gains a few more levels and [his heirloom sword](http://www.wowdb.com/items/122389-bloodsoaked-skullforge-reaver) returns to being significantly better (they're about equal now).

* &#x1f44d; Got upgrades for trinket (probably short-lived), ring, and Epic Loot!
* &#x1f44e; Still dying.
* &#x1f44e; Some new Weak Auras I tried still need some work.

### UI Modifications

I tried to split my shield block weak aura into two, with the left side being a texture indicating that I should use [Shield Wall][shield-wall], and the right side being a texture indicating that I should use [Ignore Pain][ignore-pain]. Both of these failed to trigger at all. More work needed.

#### Footnotes

[^1]: The spells are [Entangle](http://www.wowdb.com/spells/22994-entangle) and [Grasping Vines](http://www.wowdb.com/spells/22924-grasping-vines). They say they only last for ten seconds, but I could swear they affected Cordolvar for twelve. Of the two, only Grasping Vines can be dispelled (Magic), but I think it was the Entangle that did Cordolvar in.
