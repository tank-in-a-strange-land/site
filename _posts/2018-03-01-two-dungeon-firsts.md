## Progress Made

I queued Cordolvar for Burning Crusade dungeons, hoping for that sweet sweet quest experience, and he got it. I had never been in either Botanica or Mechanar. I tried to quickly skim [quickdungeon.com](http://quickdungeon.com)'s work ups for maps and boss strategies, and so I almost knew what I was doing. I was struck by the amount of trash and common loot in these two dungeons.

Cordolvar died once to trash in Botanica, for no reason I can discern. Perhaps the healer AFK'd? But I think not, since I got a [battle rez](http://www.wowdb.com/spells/20484-rebirth) shortly after dying.

In the Mechanar, the battle against Nethermancer Sepethrea was chaotic and stressful. It seems that her two summoned fire adds will not aggro to whomever has Sepethrea's aggro, which I didn't know. In addition, Sepethrea casts [Dragon's Breath](http://www.wowdb.com/spells/35250-dragons-breath), which disorients the target (usually the tank) and is dispelable, but my group didn't dispel it. While disoriented, Sepethrea will aggro the next target on their threat table---typically the healer. So I was freaking out as I helplessly watched Sepethrea run towards the healer. When the disorientation wore off, Cordolvar would immediately taunt her and start trying to get her adds controlled, only to have her cast Dragon's Breath again, causing the whole cycle to repeat over and over. Now that I've read [this comment on wowhead.com](http://www.wowhead.com/npc=19221/nethermancer-sepethrea#comments:id=25052) I don't feel as bad about how the fight went.

After those two dungeons, I queued Cordolvar for Lich King dungeons and joined a group in Gun'drak just before the final boss, which means I now have a bunch of quests in Gun'drak that I didn't really get a chance to complete. On the other hand, Cordolvar acquired a ring upgrade. Gun'drak was followed by a smooth and full run through the Culling of Stratholme.

## Random Notes

* &#x1f44d; Cordolvar got a ring upgrade.
* &#x1f44e; Died on trash for no good reason.

Queue times were a little longer than normal, I believe due to it having been a Tuesday evening, during which many players raid instead of running 5-man dungeons.

### UI Modifications

I've added a few icons that appear in a dynamic group near the top center of my screen when any of my major spells are on cooldown. I like it, but the icons aren't very recognizable, especially with cooldown numbers over top of them. Their position makes them easier to see than my action bars though. I might change it to a vertical list with progress bars and text.

I installed Deadly Boss Mods's Wrath of the Lich King and Burning Crusade add-ons. Before you think I'm a total moron, realize that I had DBM installed previously, but didn't realize that the old-world content had been split into separate add-ons. This led me to believe that DBM didn't support older 5-man dungeons, and is the reason I uninstalled it.
