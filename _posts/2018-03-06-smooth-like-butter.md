## Progress Made

This will just be a quick overview. These runs were smooth, and so there's not a ton to report.

Over the course of two sessions, Cordolvar ran through: Utgarde Pinnacle, Gundrak, Shattered Halls, Blood Furnace, Violet Hold, Steam Vaults, and Auchenai Crypts.

Interestingly, there were several "botched" pulls. By this I mean, a whole ton more mobs were pulled than expected. Either because of fear spells, or just DPS not paying attention, but Cordolvar was well supported by his healers, and was able to manage aggro well, and survived it all. They made for crazy, but very fun fights.

Cordolvar wasn't with the same party for all of the runs, but all of them went very smoothly. I had never been in Shattered Halls or Steam Vaults before, so that was a pleasant surprise.

These runs were made with a number of different DPS players and no fewer than three different healers, but they all did a great job! Upon thanking one of the healers, he commented that Cordolvar required very little healing, so I wonder if some vital stat has crossed a threshold for Cordolvar and his survivability has gone up by a noticeable margin as a result? Or perhaps the same, but for the average healer in Cordolvar's parties?

Anecdotally, as a warrior, I seem to receive the best healing from monks.

## Random Notes

* &#x1f44d; Cordolvar advanced to level 79! One more level until 80!
