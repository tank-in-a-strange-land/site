## Progress Made

### A Quick Confidence Boost

Cordolvar ran through Stonecore, which I had done the last two bosses of in my last session, so it went fairly smoothly. One trash pull did get out of hand, causing a wipe, but I don't think that was my fault. There are a number of pulls in this dungeon where its easy for things to get out of hand. I'll be trying to corral and limit these pulls in the future though to prevent things like this happening again.

The next run was a nice smooth run through City of Tolvir. I hadn't ever been here before, and said so, but no one stepped up with any advice, or wanted to really lead the way, so I did it, with a little help from quickdungeon.com's maps. I was really impressed with the healer throughout the run, so I complimented him or her when we were done, and he replied that I was easy to heal. That made me feel good, and was a nice bump for my confidence.

### A Previous Friend Returns

Joining up with a healer from some earlier runs, Cordolvar headed into Vortex Pinnacle. Said healer was level at this time level 90 (Cordolvar was level 85), and the party had some trouble with Grand Vizier Ertan. My healer friend complained that he felt like he was doing about 50% of his usual healing. He was concerned that he might have hit a scaling point at level 90 that made the encounters particularly difficult.

Luckily the party rallied together and with some smart pulls and ample crowd control, we finished the rest of he dungeon without a hitch. Cordolvar was lucky enough to loot the [Drake of the North Wind](https://www.wowdb.com/spells/88742-drake-of-the-north-wind), a rare dragon mount.

Next we headed into Stonecore to join a group already in progress. We quickly and quietly cleared the last two bosses, advancing Cordolvar to level 86, and acquiring upgrades for his ring and bracers.

## Random Notes

* &#x1f44d; Drake of the North Wind!
* &#x1f44d; Cordolvar upgraded a ring and his bracers.
* &#x1f44e; Level scaling apparently has a few rough spots.

Why is there no achievement for running 100 dungeon instances?
