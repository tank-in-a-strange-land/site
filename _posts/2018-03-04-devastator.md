## Progress Made

I started the morning out in Auchenai Crypts, where Cordolvar died on the first trash pull. I noticed the healer stopped doing anything about halfway through the pull (I had made sure he was active when I started the pull), so I asked what was up, and he responded "massive lag spike". One of the DPS apparently experienced the same thing. There's not much you can do about that I guess.

I made my own mistake on [Shirrak the Dead Watcher](https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/18371-shirrak-the-dead-watcher), who was pulled by a DPS (preventing me from using [Intercept][intercept]). I tanked him on the stairs, which I suppose isn't ever a great idea, but in this case it's really bad, since he has an area of effect damage spell he casts and people couldn't see it very well on the stairs. Sounded like maybe the healer didn't know to stay away from the boss either, which might not have helped (the boss casts [Inhibit Magic](https://www.wowdb.com/spells/32264-inhibit-magic), which increases the casting time of his nearby targets).

Next was Shadow Labyrinth, where I mucked up our first attempt on [Murmur](https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/18708-murmur). Good old Deadly Boss Mods, which I had just barely re-installed, told me to run away from Murmur, so I did, but if all players are outside melee range, he does massive damage through [Resonance](https://www.wowdb.com/spells/33657-resonance). The tank is supposed to just fight through it. I didn't know, so I ran, and died. The party wiped. No one seemed too upset about it thankfully. The second attempt went very smoothly. For tanks, it's a simple tank'n'spank.

My next roll of the dice landed Cordolvar in Old Hillsbrad Foothills, which went smoothly. I like the concept of the Cavern of Time dungeons, though the roleplay sections can take forever and be annoying.

Next was Arcatraz, which went smoothly, and advanced Cordolvar to level 75 (thanks to the Darkmoon Faire's extra 10% experience buff!)

Lastly, I took Cordolvar back to Wrath of the Lich King and Violet Hold, which was a nice smooth run.

## Random Notes

* &#x1f44d; Level 75 and with it a new talent.
* &#x1f44d; Cordolvar got a belt upgrade.
* &#x1f44e; Died due to ignorance of fight mechanics.

Truth be told, I'm glad I died to fight mechanics. There have been too few fights where knowing the fight mechanics makes any difference at all. It's better than dying to lag spikes anyway.

The [Devastator][devastator] talent is really going to take some getting used it. It replaces the protection warrior's "filler" ability, [Devastate][devastate], and makes it a passive on weapon swing. As a result, I have empty GCDs where there's nothing to cast, and it feels really weird. Plus now I have to figure out what to put in that spot in my action bars. It's too good of a spot to leave empty.

### UI Modifications

I changed my GCD [Weak Aura]({% link _ui_mods/weak-auras.md %}) to anchor it to my Personal Resource Display.
