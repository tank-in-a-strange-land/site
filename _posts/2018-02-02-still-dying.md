Yep, I died again. On trash in Razorfen Kraul. Either the healer got overwhelmed or stunned or something.

## Progress Made

Cordolvar has joined a guild as a casual member. Why not, the perks are nice, right? As a good guildie, Cordolvar of course wants to improve his reputation with the guild, and since Love Is In The Air started today, I did a number of quests for that. I'm counting the Crown Chemical Co. Battle as a half of a dungeon, but it really isn't even that. Doing (non-dungeon) quests has reminded me that questing as a Protection Warrior is rather slow. At one point I was able to get four mobs on me at once though, and when you can do that, it helps a lot. I'm just over halfway to reaching friendly with Cordolvar's guild, so there might be more non-dungeon questing in my future, sadly.

Tonight might have been my first time in Mauradon: Earth Song Falls (ever). I didn't recognize any of it, except the Princess seemed a little familiar. Anyway, it was a fast run. A little too fast for my taste. Of course I didn't know where I was going, and I hadn't [read any of the encounters](http://quickdungeon.com/maraudon-earth-song-falls/), but things seemed to go just fine.

## Random Notes

I'm starting to get into a good rhythm with my rotation. My [GCD weak aura]({% link _ui_mods/weak-auras.md %}) really helps me time my attacks, so I'm not spamming as much, which means I'm calmer and better able to focus. The sound that triggers ("Robot Blip") when _Shield Bash_ is available is distinct, even in a busy fight. Sometimes I don't use _Thunder Clap_ as often as I should, but I'm not too worried about that---I'll get better. I am considering creating a weak aura to help me remember though. I'll have to think about it a little bit more.

I got upgrades for Cordolvar's belt and one ring. I like the pace at which he's getting upgrades. I know that the stats on my heirlooms are enough that the other pieces hardly matter, but I'm averaging close to an upgrade per dungeon, and that helps make it feel more worthwhile.

I've added a weak aura to display an icon when my health is less than 60% and _Last Stand_ is available. It also plays a sound (I can't remember which one right now).

I've also noticed that the random dungeon finder doesn't queue you for low-level dungeons, even if they do scale to your level. The ranges seem to be about the same as they were before the zone scaling took effect in patch 7.3.5. I'm a little disappointed actually---it would be fun to run Deadmines and other low-level dungeons once in a while, maybe with a reduced chance as your level gets higher. On the bright side I don't have to worry about doing Gnomeregan any more.
