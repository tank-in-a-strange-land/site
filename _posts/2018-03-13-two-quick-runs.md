## Progress Made

I didn't have a lot of time last night, but I had a very short wait before the queue popped and sent Cordolvar to Blackrock Caverns. It was an average sort of run. I wiped the party a few times on Karsh Steelbender, as moving him where he needs to go is pretty tricky. I've been lucky enough to get parties that have been both patient and constructive---for which I'm very grateful. Lag caused healing problems a few times, which in turn caused a few deaths for Cordolvar. So it goes.

This party's DPS had far less trouble with the Borers than previous runs. No crowd control was needed, the mobs melted to the party's superior firepower.

Then I took the leap into the Mists of Pandaria dungeon queue. Cordolvar was whisked away to the beautiful Shadowpan Monastery. The party urged me to go forward quickly, despite me not knowing the fights. We wiped once on trash, but otherwise it was okay. I had no idea where I was most of the time. I felt like the dungeon was fairly straightforward, but with all of the moving inside and out, up and down, it was hard to keep my bearings.

Our party's leader was familiar with the dungeon, and we were able to skip a number of trash pulls, which was nice.

My first impression is that it is a well-designed and beautiful dungeon---what I've come to expect from Blizzard, and that's a good thing. I hope the other dungeons in Mists of Pandaria share those traits.

## Random Notes

* &#x1f44d; Cordolvar upgraded his belt.
* &#x1f44e; Died a lot. I had really hoped that I would down Karsh on the first attempt.
* &#x1f44d; Queue times where short, less than ten seconds each time.
