Cordolvar ran two proper dungeons---in a row--without dying. Amazing!

## Progress Made

First up was a run through Utgarde Keep. It was a slow run. A rogue, a warrior and a hunter don't combine for much area of effect damage, and it made a number of fights harder. That's just how it goes though. No one died, and we defeated all the bosses.

Next was Ahnâ€™kahet: The Old Kingdom which was about as smooth a run as could be imagined.

The strangest thing was having to wait about twenty seconds (gasp!) for each of these runs! With healers split between Wrath of the Lich King dungeons and Burning Crusade dungeons, queue times are no longer instantaneous.

After this, a friend ran Cordolvar through Azjol-Nerub, Ahn'kahet, and Utgarde Keep. We started out trying for Naxxramus, but Cordolvar couldn't enter the raid. I guess his level isn't high enough. There was no indication though, which is a shame. These runs were fast, and of course Cordolvar didn't die, but they were also a bit boring, and didn't yield as much experience or loot as I expected. In fact, in what I thought was a very strange twist, the mobs in UK yielded around 4x the experience of mobs in AN!

## Random Notes

* &#x1f44d; Got upgrade for Cordolvar's boots and belt.
* &#x1f44d; No deaths!
* &#x1f44e; Surprisingly little experience for runs made with a level 110 in attendance.

#### Footnotes

[^1]: Three runs were made in a party with a level 110, so these don't totally count.
