I only had time for three quick runs tonight, but they went fairly smoothly. I still managed to die however.

## Progress Made

Cordolvar tanked Scarlet Monastery, Gnomeregan, and Blackfathom Deeps. He died once in Scarlet Monastery. In the trash leading up to Brother Korloff, I somehow managed not to notice that my healer had aggro'd some mobs behind me. As a result, he was unable to heal Cordolvar sufficiently, and Cordolvar died. I think this one's on me. I will add to my [Situational Awareness Checklist]({% link situational-awareness-checklist.md %}), "Scan the party's unit frames for aggro."

On the bright side, I'm pretty sure I knew my way through Blackfathom Deeps this time. The group Cordolvar was with must not have known the dungeon well, as they seemed happy to let Cordolvar lead. The group was entirely ranged DPS, which was unusual, but nice, as it meant I was free to move mobs around as I wanted to without having to worry about forcing any party members to adjust their own positions.

## Random Notes
* &#x1f44d; Got upgrades for both of my rings.
* &#x1f44e; Still haven't managed even a short session without dying.
* Cordolvar now has [Last Stand][last-stand], which means he has two "oh no" buttons, and this makes me much happier.

### UI Modifications

I'm trying out Tidy Plates: Threat Plates using magenta for mobs that I don't have aggro on, indigo for those that I'm losing aggro on, and red for those I have aggro on. I definitely prefer this to the default colors. I've also removed the health values from the bars---I consider that clutter. A percentage is useful, but the fact that the boss has 8,195 hit points left isn't useful to me. I also switched all the fonts to Fritz Quadrata TT which seems to be what just about everything else uses. Having a different font just makes things harder to read.

I'm still not sure how much I like TP:TP, but I'm going to keep it around for at least a bit longer.

I added [Clique]({% link _ui_mods/clique.md %}) configurations for [Intercept][intercept], it's probably more useful for zipping ahead in dungeons, but maybe it'll be useful. I also added one for [Taunt][taunt], in case I'm too lazy to click-to-target before I click-to-taunt.

I adjusted my [Victory Rush][victory-rush] Weak Aura, renaming it to [Impending Victory][impending-victory] and adjusting the health-based trigger to when Cordolvar is below 85% max health. I changed the sound on the _Shield Slam_ aura to "Robot Blip", and I definitely hear this one much more clearly while in combat. I think I'll try to tweak this one by seeing if it can trigger not only when I have a target, but when I have a target that's within range. <ins>Update: It doesn't appear this is possible with just stock Weak Auras, oh well.</ins>
