Yep, Cordolvar died some more. Once in Maraudon my healer just goofed. Then later on, still in Maraudon, someone in the party wasn't paying attention and pulled an extra pack of mobs that proved to be too much for the healer to keep up with[^1].

## Progress Made

I started out at the Darkmoon Faire (DMF), since I could do a bunch of the daily quests there for guild reputation. Once I hit friendly, I bought an [Illustrious Guild Tabard][illustrious-guild-tabard], and hit the dungeon finder. If the DMF is in town, remember that you can ride the carousel there for a one hour buff that increases experience gained by 10%.

Cordolvar started out in Maraudon: The Wicked Grotto, and the group continued well into Earth Song Falls before one of the DPS left. Thinking that re-queuing us would get us another DPS, I queued us, but sadly, that teleported the group to Scarlet Monastery. Whoops. We completed SM without any problems however, so I've finally got a clean kill on Brother Korloff.

Being reasonably pleased with the group, I queued us again, and we got Razorfen Kraul, which also went smoothly, if not terribly quickly. I'm still OK with this, as I'm working on rotations still. Things are feeling more natural. I continue to internalize my weak auras/spell alerts, and so things are starting to "slow down" and not feel so hectic. This is a good sign.

## Random Notes

* &#x1f44d; Got upgrades for Cordolvar's belt and one ring.
* &#x1f44d; Had some really good pulls, and good pick ups when DPS pulled extra stuff.
* &#x1f44d; Managed to defeat Brother Korloff without dying.
* &#x1f44e; _Still_ haven't had a session without a death.

### UI Modifications

I need to adjust my [Shield Block][shield-block] [weak aura]({% link _ui_mods/weak-auras.md %}) so it won't trigger is Shield Block is already up, since having reached level 38, Cordolvar's Shield Block now has two charges. Having two charges is great too.

I saw a spell description that I want to investigate further: [Revenge Trigger](http://www.wowdb.com/spells/5301-revenge-trigger). If this is an aura applied when that [Revenge][revenge] procs for a rage-free cast, then perhaps I can use this (and other _&lt;Spell&gt;_ Trigger spells) to configure my weak auras to **not** trigger on the procs. This is desirable because Blizzard's default spell alerts trigger on procs, and I don't like having both my weak aura and Blizzard's spell alerts triggering at the same time. It's extra clutter and distraction[^2].

#### Footnotes

[^1]:
    The extra pack was either [Creeping Sludge](http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/12222-creeping-sludge) or [Noxious Slime](http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/12221-noxious-slime), I don't remember which. They have massive melee damage, and so this death is not on the healer, or myself (unless it was the healer that pulled the mobs!)
