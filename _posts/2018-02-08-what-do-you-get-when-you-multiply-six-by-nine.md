## Progress Made

Last night's death was in Scholomance. Cordolvar got schooled in potions by [Professor Slate](http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/59613-professor-slate) and about ten of his students. Not knowing the fight well, I asked if we needed to clear the trash (students) before taking on the boss. After receiving an affirmative response, Cordolvar sauntered down a classroom aisle and used [Heroic Throw][heroic-throw] to pull a group of about five students. Somehow that managed to aggro two groups of students; so about ten casters. At this point I was worried. Then I noticed the boss had been aggro'd (and I don't think by me). Cordolvar quickly [Taunted][taunt] the boss, and held on for dear life as I used every cooldown Cordolvar had, but the party still wiped. Oh well. The group got a good laugh out of it. It was one of those comical "oh snap!" moments. Once we regrouped, Cordolvar cleanly pulled the student groups one at a time, and by using line of sight got them away from Professor Slate and grouped up for AoE.

Cordolvar's next two runs took him to Maraudon, both Wicked Grotto and Earth Song Falls. Both runs were smooth and quick. I'm so ready to be done with Maraudon, not because it's a horrible dungeon---it's not---but just because I've done it so many times now and I could use a break.

I experimented with [Ignore Pain][ignore-pain] freely. It's a very powerful spell. But, at least in five-man dungeons, I don't think it needs to be used a lot. On boss fights, or when the healer is stunned, it's a great tool for reducing incoming damage. However, on trash packs, I think that one's rage is better spent on [Revenge][revenge] to kill things faster. This is something I'll be thinking about more as time goes on though. In a group with an offensive-minded healer, it could be more efficient to use Ignore Pain to minimize incoming damage, so that the healer can cast more offensive spells.

I noticed that Cordolvar can maintain 100% uptime in [Shield Block][shield-block][^2]. I'm a little sad that I hadn't noticed this before. Up until now, I made free use of Shield Block, but wasn't particularly concerned about its uptime. I'll try to get as close to 100% uptime as I can in future dungeon runs as practice for when things like this are more critical. I believe this can be tracked with a damage meter, and I have [Details!]({% link ui-mods.md %}) installed.

## Random Notes

* &#x1f44d; Got a gloves upgrade.
* &#x1f44d; Only three more levels until I won't queue for Maraudon anymore.
* Lately, Cordolvar is often joining groups mid-dungeon. These groups haven't been terrible, so why'd their tank leave?

### UI Modifications

My idea to [check the combat log for an event indicating that the cooldown for Shield Slam was reset]({% link _posts/2018-02-06-level-40.md %}#ui-modifications) didn't work out. If the combat log identifies when Devastate, Thunder Clap, or Revenge proc to reset the cooldown on Shield Slam, I wasn't able to find it. However, I did find another way to accomplish what I wanted, and I'm pleased with the results. The whole explanation is long, so I've written it on [its own page]({% link ui-mods-weak-auras-shield-slam.md %}).

[^2]:By default there would be one second of downtime every other cast, but Cordolvar has enough haste on his gear to make 100% uptime possible right now.
