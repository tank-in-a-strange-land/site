## Progress Made

Since I've never done any Warlords of Draenor content, I started the quest line so Cordolvar could establish his garrison, if nothing else. I enjoyed the quests and cut-scenes and found the introductions of the various warlords really enjoyable. Now Cordolvar's garrison is founded, and he has a barracks. I plan to continue to develop his garrison for a bit longer, but I'll probably queue him for some dungeons soon.

## Random Notes

* &#x1f44d; Cordolvar's garrison is founded.
* &#x1f44e; Protection warriors take a long time to kill things on their own.
* &#x1f44d; Protection warriors can round up any number of mobs at once and grind them down.
* &#x1f44e; No dungeons run.

As noted above, Cordolvar doesn't kill things very fast, but I've yet to find a mob that does more than tickle him, so grabbing aggro from as many as possible at once isn't a problem at all.

Cordolvar grabbed a few uncommon-level upgrades, which were significantly better[^1] than the rare pieces he had from running dungeons. That's kind of sad, but then, that's how new expansions go I suppose.

### UI Modifications

I added [Heroic Leap][heroic-leap] to my cooldowns [Weak Aura]({% link _ui_mods/weak-auras.md %}).

{% include powers.md %}

#### Footnotes

[^1]: On the order of 70-80% better, according to [Pawn]({% link ui-mods.md %}).
