Obviously levels gained no longer makes sense. This is the last time I'll show it.

## Progress Made

Cordolvar has been working to [unite the Broken Isles](https://www.wowdb.com/quests/45727-uniting-the-isles), and earn his [Flight Master's Whistle](https://www.wowdb.com/items/141605-flight-masters-whistle). He achieved friendly with the Nightborne, and then established diplomatic relations with the Court of Farondis in Aszuna.

## Random Notes

* &#x1f44d; Suramar is pretty.
* &#x1f44e; I forgot to apply equipment updates to my order hall followers.

I've been banking a small amount of artifact power (like literally in my bank), in case it becomes scarce as I progress. I want to make sure I can put at least some into my off-spec warrior artifact weapons. This is probably silly, but until I have a chance to do more reading, it feels like a reasonable thing.

### UI Modifications

I made some tweaks to how my shield block icon is displayed, and learned more about the quirks of Weak Auras. Functionally, very little was changed, but I feel like the learning curve is becoming less steep. Still not ready to show what I'm working on though.
