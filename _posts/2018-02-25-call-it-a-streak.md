title: Call It A Streak

The no-death streak continues. The verdict is in on getting run through dungeons.

## Progress Made

First up was Drak'Tharon Keep. The run was nice and smooth, though Cordolvar did miss a step required for a quest. The healer and one DPS re-queued with Cordolvar into Azjol-Nerub. This made me nervous, after what happened [the last time]({% link _posts/2018-02-22-trouble-in-an.md %}). I warned the group, and asked them to please let Hadronox come all the way up the ramp before engaging. They obliged, and we cleared the dungeon without any issues. It was joyous---and a relief. I feel vindicated.

After a quick break, it was back into the Nexus. One party member died to the little crystaline plants and wasn't able to re-join the group. We had to battle Ormorok the Tree-Shaper without her, but we managed fine. There can be quite a range in quality of DPS players. Some groups can finish things very quickly, while others... Not so much. But, as long as no one is being a jerk about speeding the group along, I'm fine either way.

The dungeons are becoming more and more familiar. I use a combination of a map on another screen and general familiarity to navigate, and I'm happy with my progress---even with my mistake in The Nexus.

## Random Notes

I noticed that I received far more experience for monsters killed in a group with players of my own level than I was when being run through the dungeons by a friend's level 110 character. On the order of 50&times; more experience. So getting runs from a level 110 is not good for leveling at any rate.

* &#x1f44d; Five dungeons without a death! I've added a new row to the Quick Stats table.
* &#x1f44d; Cordolvar got gloves and belt upgrades.
* &#x1f44e; I screwed up navigating The Nexus, which might have been a factor in a party member's death, and missing out on a boss.

### UI Modifications

I want to try adding the Quartz add-on, so I can have my target's cast bar in a static position. That might help with interrupts, and dodging frontal cone attacks. It's probably not a big deal though.
