title: Epic Blackrock Depths Run
---
I had a ton of fun running Blackrock Depths. Cordolvar still died, but who cares? The point is to have fun! BRD is a truly epic dungeon, which makes sense, because it was a raid when World of Warcraft was first released.

## Progress Made

The first random dungeon was Blackrock Depths: Detention center. Cordolvar had never been there before, and so there were a great number of quests to be done. Usually Dungeon Finder groups skip the first five of seven bosses, but luckily this group was game to start at the beginning and do them all.

We had a miscommunication at the start, and the party accidentally separated. Our poor healer wasn't able to keep up, and so Cordolvar took a dirt nap. After that we stuck together, and the healer did an amazing job, keeping Cordolvar alive through a great number of tough fights, and an equally great number of blunders of my part.

The party had a lot of trouble finding our way around. It didn't help that I led us to Bael'Gar right off of the bat (Bael'Gar is usually the fifth boss fought). It took us a good while to figure out how to find Houndmaster Grebmar, and I had to lookup how to get all of the relic keys (which while we got, we never had time to open all twelve).

BRD has a number of side passages, small or hidden doors, dead ends and the like. There are lots of packs of trash mobs, and it's *very* easy to pull multiple packs. Lots of mobs cast fear spells (which can send party members running to nearby packs, pulling them) and lots of mobs have blizzard or heal spells (both of which should be interrupted whenever possible).

Is it the case that it always feels like you're the only one interrupting spells? Our DPS included two hunters and a mage, so maybe they don't have interrupts?[^1] I thought mages had counterspell?[^2] I guess it just always feels like you're the only one interrupting.

Anyway, we had a lot of fun fumbling around, joking, getting lost, grabbing extra packs of mobs mid-fight. Grabbing _bosses_ mid-fight (I didn't know that Lord Roccor patrols the tunnels surrounding the Ring of Law!)

So I added a few friends to my friends list from this run. It was the only dungeon Cordolvar ran last night, and we were in there for just over two very fun-filled hours. Good times. I hope we do it again soon.

Oh, and in addition to Detention Center, we managed to do first four bosses of the Upper City as well.

## Random Notes

* &#x1f44d; Got boots upgrade.
* &#x1f44d; Had a ton of fun.
* &#x1f44e; Still have no idea how to get around in BRD.

It seems like a good idea to try and use [Shield Block][shield-block] before [Ignore Pain][ignore-pain], as the latter can use a variable amount of rage. It's very easy to leave yourself without enough rage to cast Shield Block after using Ignore Pain.

### UI Modifications

I tweaked a number of my weak auras. I split my Shield Block WA so its only on the left, and added one for Ignore Pain on the right. I added duration progress bars for both Shield Block and Ignore Pain as well. Basically I'm trying to help myself be more aware of when those spells are wearing off, so I can maintain higher uptimes. Speaking of which, I guess I should do a better job of noting my uptime, so I can track my progress. As a result, a number of the weak auras on my [weak auras]({% link _ui_mods/weak-auras.md %}) page are out of date. I'll try to get them updated soon.
