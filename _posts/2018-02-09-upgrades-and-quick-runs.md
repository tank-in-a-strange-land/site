I didn't have much time last night, but I managed to get three gear upgrades for Cordolvar, while only dying twice.

## Progress Made

The first dungeon was Maraudon: Foulspore Cavern, and it was a circus. The DPS uptime was very poor, and the healer must have been distracted. I pulled the first group of Noxious Slime, keeping well clear of the other groups. But somehow another group got pulled anyway. Then another group. I wish I knew how. I'm pretty certain it wasn't me, but I guess I can't be 100% sure.

As bad as the first run was, the second managed to be worse. This time it was Razorfen Kraul. While working through the first hallway, I noticed I wasn't getting healed and was dangerously low on health. I looked back to see that the healer had tripped a trap, and was being harassed by a quilboar.

So I ran back, still mostly dead to taunt that quilboar off of the healer. But Cordolvar still got no heals, and died. Am I the only player that sees the tripwires in Razorfen Kraul? Because every party I go there with trips them, but they're clear as day on my screen. Admittedly, I should have noticed that the healer had aggro sooner; I have party frames that indicate aggro, and checking them is part of my [situational awareness checklist]({% link situational-awareness-checklist.md %}). So I'm half to blame for this one. At the same time, the healer could have brought the mob to me, or at the very least said something in `/group`. To do neither was negligent on his or her part.

We continued on mostly smoothly until we reached [Roogug](http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/74948-roogug). After we wore him down to about 50% health, Cordolvar stopped getting heals. I checked aggro, but that was fine. I continued to take damage, and so went through cooldowns, but still no heals. Cordolvar died again, but the party was able to finish off Roogug. After resurrecting Cordolvar, the healer said that he was silenced. Roogug does drop a Solarshard Totem, causing silence. You'd think after the first time you were affected by its "pillar of blinding light", you'd stay away from the pillars. This was a frustrating run.

After a quick break, Scholomance was next up. I don't know this dungeon very well, but we managed well enough. One of the DPS was killed while Cordolvar was fighting off the mobs from [Harsh Lesson](http://www.wowdb.com/spells/113395-harsh-lesson). If there was anything I could have done to prevent that, I don't know what it was.

Overall, a frustrating session, I hope that the next one will be better.

* &#x1f44d; Got upgraded boots, bracers, and gloves.
* &#x1f44e; Still died.

### UI Modifications

I thought I could maintain 100% uptime on [Shield Block][shield-block], but that proved not to be the case. I need to do more experiments, but it seems more like 66% uptime is the maximum. I was able to get as high as 62%. This means I'll need to readjust my [Weak Aura]({% link _ui_mods/weak-auras.md %}) for Shield Block.
