title: One Quick Run
---
Three nights ago I only had a little time to play, so Cordolvar only completed one dungeon run: Lower Blackrock Spire.

## Quick Stats

|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
|                 | Since Last Update | Total |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| Deaths          | 0!!![^1]          | 22    |
| Dungeons Tanked | 1                 | 51    |
| Levels Gained   | 1                 | 59    |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------|

## Progress Made

No deaths! Amazing. Granted I only ran a single dungeon, but LBRS is hardly a short dungeon. It has a total of nine bosses, and Cordolvar's group defeated them all. Cordolvar looted [a belt upgrade](http://www.wowdb.com/items/51985-stalwart-belt), and a [really nice ring](http://www.wowdb.com/items/13143-mark-of-the-dragon-lord), that I'm surprised wasn't an upgrade for him. Trying to follow the maps from Quick Dungeon was kinda a joke (there are nine different levels), but thankfully, some of the other party members knew their way around pretty well. I wasn't totally lost, as I had run this dungeon a couple of times on a previous character.

## Random Notes

* &#x1f44d; No deaths! Amazing.
* &#x1f44d; Got a belt upgrade.
* &#x1f44e; Only ran a single dungeon.

I'm working on an "Old World Retrospective" that will review my goals and go over the highs and lows of tanking through levels 15-60.

### UI Modifications

Part of why I only had time to run a single dungeon, was because I was trying to fix my [ignore pain and shield block weak aura textures]({% link _ui_mods/weak-auras.md %}). I'm glad to say I was successful! The shield block texture now has three triggers:

1. Have aggro from at least one mob.
1. Action usable: Shield Block.
1. Aura: Shield Block: missing.

I had previously failed to be able to specify the third item in the list. Turns out there's a simple selection box in the trigger that needs to be set to "Missing" and voil√†! Ignore pain's is similar, except that it also won't trigger unless the shield block aura is already present. This is because I want to prioritize [Shield Block][shield-block] over [Ignore Pain][ignore-pain], since Ignore Pain can drain all of Cordolvar's rage, leaving too little rage to then cast Shield Block. I could make this more sophisticated by adding a trigger to show the texture anyway if health drops below 70% or so. I could also show the texture if rage is high enough to cast both. Maybe I'll work on that next time.

#### Footnotes

[^1]: Of course, Cordolvar only ran a single dungeon, still, it's a small victory.
