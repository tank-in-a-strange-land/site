## Progress Made

First up was the Siege of Niuzao Temple, where Cordolvar died once on the first boss, Vizier Jin'bak. Pro-tip: If the party's DPS don't keep the size of the sap puddle in check, just carefully kite the boss into it from time to time, so that it's not too big when the boss detonates it (the damage of which is proportional to the size of the sap pool).

Next was Gate of the Setting Sun, which was a smooth run, with the exception of my game client freezing up right before the third boss. I quickly rebooted and logged back in to find that the party had killed the third boss without me! Nice. We finished up the last boss quickly.

The queue then dished up Niuzao Temple and Gate of the Setting Sun again, so I ran them each twice, which is good because it helps cement the boss mechanics. Plus it gave me a chance to tank the third boss in Gate of the Setting Sun, Commander Ri'mok, which is a fun fight since he more or less constantly drops green puddles on the floor that he needs to be moved out of.

## Random Notes

* &#x1f44d; Cordolvar got a lot of upgrades, including a belt, gloves, bracers, and two rings.
* &#x1f44e; Game client freezes aren't fun at all.
* &#x1f44e; Upgrading my heirlooms to level 100 cost about 25% of the gold I've amassed so far across all my characters.

I suppose many seasoned players will laugh that I even notice the expense of upgrading heirlooms, but I don't have a level 110 character yet, in fact, Cordolvar is the highest level character I have. I'm not looking forward to seeing my poor gold balance after I upgrade his heirlooms to level 110!
