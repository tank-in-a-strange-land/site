## Progress Made

This update covers two separate periods, which is why there are more dungeons tanked than usual. Cordolvar started out with a few Burning Crusade dungeons. While I'm not in a rush to level, it just makes sense to do both Wrath of the Lich King and Burning Crusade dungeons in order to get the quest experience from all of them. So first up was Blood Furnace with a DPS member that just sat at the entrance until we kicked him. Two DPS are enough, but it makes things more stressful. On top of one of the DPS not showing up, Cordolvar did more damage than one of the other DPS---even on boss fights. I don't know what it takes to out DPS a tank, but it doesn't seem like much. I'm usually at around half the DPS of the party's best DPS player.

Next was Underbog, where the entire party save the healer was lagging at over 200 ms. This too induced stress as things just didn't respond the way you'd expect. I noticed that it was hard to time [Intercept][intercept] and cooldown management was a bit scarier.

Last for that play session was Violet Hold (yes, back in Wrath of the Lich King dungeons) where I died on the boss Xevozz for no reason I could discern, other than that the healer either lagged, or fell asleep. Cordolvar did get upgraded gloves out of the deal though.

My next play session found Cordolvar in Utgarde Keep for a pretty average run. One of the DPS was more interested in quest things and mining than fighting, but at least I didn't die. That seems to be a theme in UK, maybe it's because it's one of the first dungeons you can run upon reaching Northrend?

Halls of Stone was next, and went smoothly, despite me missing a quest along the way.

Culling of Stratholme took a while, but the party included a great healer and three great DPS players, so it was a joy to work with them. Cordolvar got a belt upgrade.

The last run for the session was Utgarde Pinnacle, which was okay except for some crazy DPS-player pulls and when the healer fell asleep or something causing Cordolvar to die on trash.

## Random Notes

If you want to let your tank know that you don't appreciate them, spend all your time jumping and mining and getting quest objectives when the rest of the party is clearing trash. Or if you're a healer, just go AFK without saying anything. Okay, rant over. I love tanking, it's the most fun I have in the game, but it's too bad that there are so many inconsiderate players. I guess I need to remind myself that it's just a game.

Queue times have been hanging out in the sub-30 second range, which is fine, though not as nice as the instantaneous queues of Classic dungeons. I wonder why the change? Do healers prefer to do Burning Crusade dungeons? Or will it get better now at level 70 because maybe people still do 60-70 in BC dungeons before coming to WotLK dungeons?

* &#x1f44d; Cordolvar acquired two upgrades---belt and gloves.
* &#x1f44d; Level 70, and with it, faster flying.
* &#x1f44d; [Enchant Boots: Minor Speed](http://www.wowdb.com/items/38837-enchant-boots-minor-speed) makes dungeons runs a little faster and less stressful.
* &#x1f44e; I felt grumpy after experiencing inconsiderate party members.

### UI Modifications

I'm going to turn off my [Weak Auras progress bars]({% link _ui_mods/weak-auras.md %}) for Ignore Pain and Shield Block. Now that I have the stock Personal Resource Display re-enabled, it shows buff durations, so the progress bars aren't really needed.

I've also added Quartz so I can have my target's cast bar in a static location, and that seems a little better, but I'm still not aware of it as I'd like to be. It might just need a bit more time.
