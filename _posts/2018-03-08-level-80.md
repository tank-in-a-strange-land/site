## Progress Made

After running Magister's Terrace for the first time, where Cordolvar died twice on trash pulls that got out of hand, he advanced to level 80 and decided it was time to head to Vashj'ir. As a player, I've never advanced a character beyond level 80, so this is all new content for me. That's why I enjoyed the cut scene and took some time to run a few of the Vashj'ir quests. The underwater areas are all very nicely done. I love the colors---not overly bright---but still interesting. The wealth of sea life, both flora and fauna, is wonderful to see. I'm very impressed.

## Random Notes

* &#x1f44d; New content for me to experience!
* &#x1f44e; Still dying to trash.
* &#x1f44d; Level 80!

I dislike how often I die on trash pulls. On the one hand they should be easier than boss fights, but I guess a lot of players don't pay a ton of attention during them. Also, there are a handful of trash mobs that hit surprisingly hard.
