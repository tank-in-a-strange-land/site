# Shadowfang Keep

## Baron Ashbury

Forsaken.

##### Notes:
* Clear adds first.
* Will cast Asphyxiate, which lifts all party members into the air, doing serious damage. Use your cooldowns. After the spell, he'll cast a healing spell, but this is a risky time all the same, and stressful for your healer.
* Does lots of shadow damage.
* At 25% health, will enter Dark Archangel form and do massive shadow damage to anyone nearby.

##### Questions:
* Should melee withdraw when he enters Dark Archangel form at 25% health?

## Baron Silverlaine

Human ghost.

##### Notes:
* Casts a spell that reduces healing on its target by 50%. This can, and should, be dispelled.
* Summons worgen spirits to aid him, pick up the adds, and burn them before going back to the boss.

## Commander Springvale

Human ghost (paladin).

##### Notes:
* Stay out of the fire (desecration).
* Word of Shame is a nasty DoT.
* Summons adds, pick up the adds. DPS should prioritize killing the adds.

## Lord Walden

Forsaken.

##### Notes:
* Stay out of the fire. It has several forms.

## Lord Godfrey

Forsaken.

##### Notes:
* Cursed bullets is a nasty DoT. Interrupt if possible, dispell if possible, otherwise use a cooldown.
* Pistol barrage is a nasty cone based attack, spread out. Tank him facing away from the group.
* Summons adds.

##### Questions:
* Does he move during pistol barrage? If not, get behind him.
* Do ghoul adds need to be tanked?
