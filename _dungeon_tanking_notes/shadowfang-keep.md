## Baron Ashbury

Forsaken.

##### Notes:
* Clear adds first.
* Will cast Asphyxiate, which lifts all party members into the air, doing serious damage. Use your cooldowns. After the spell, he'll cast a healing spell, but this is a risky time all the same, and stressful for your healer.
* Does lots of shadow damage.

## Baron Silverlaine

Human ghost.

##### Notes:
* Casts a spell that reduces healing on its target by 50%. This can, and should, be dispelled.
* Summons worgen spirits to aid him, pick up the adds.

## Commander Springvale

Human ghost (paladin).

##### Notes:
* Stay out of the fire (desecration).
* Summons adds, pick up the adds. DPS should prioritize killing the adds.

## Lord Walden

Forsaken.

##### Notes:
* Stay out of the fire. It has several forms.

## Lord Godfrey

Forsaken.

##### Notes:
* Cursed bullets is a nasty <abbr title="Damage over Time">DoT</abbr>. Interrupt or dispell as soon as possible, otherwise use a cooldown.
* Pistol barrage is a attack spraying out from the boss in a cone. Melee (including the tank) should step to the side to avoid it.
* Summons adds.

##### Questions:
* Do ghoul adds need to be tanked?
