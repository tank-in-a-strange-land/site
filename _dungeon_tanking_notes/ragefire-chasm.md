# Ragefire Chasm

## Foreword

I knew none of the boss tactics going into this dungeon. I tanked using only the basics of "don't stand in the fire" and "try to face the boss away from the group", and my healers never had any issues with any of these fights.

## Adarogg

A flame hound.

##### Notes:
* Breathes fire, so melee DPS should be behind.
* Charges random players, doing damage to any other player within three yards. So spread out.

## Dark Shaman Koranthal

Orc shaman.

##### Notes:
* Stay out of the "fire".

## Slagmaw

Lava worm.

##### Notes:
* Will disappear and reappear in a new location.
* Can be hit by heroic throw even if you're up in his face.

## Lava Guard Gordoth

Orc shaman.

##### Notes:
* Does an AoE damaging anyone close at all, so ranged should be well back.
* Has a knockback.
