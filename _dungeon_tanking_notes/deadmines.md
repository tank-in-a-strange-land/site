# Deadmines

## Foreword

I knew none of the boss tactics going into this dungeon. I tanked using only the basics of "don't stand in the fire" and "try to face the boss away from the group", and my healers never had any issues with any of these fights.

## Glubtok

An ogre mage.

##### Primary:
* Taunt him when he blinks.

##### Secondary:
* When he shoots beams out his sides, don't stand there.
* Pick up any adds summoned.
* Try not to stand in any fire or frost on the ground.

##### Notes:
I'm sure I stood in the fire a few times during this fight, and it didn't seem to stress my healers at all.

## Helix Gearbreaker

A goblin, riding the shoulders of a lumbering oaf.

##### Primary:
* He can jump onto a player's shoulders and attach a bomb to them. Move away from the targeted player.
* His oaf can tackle a player into a wood pile, stay out of the path.

##### Secondary:
* Stay away from bombs on the ground.

##### Notes:
My healers have not had a problem with this fight, even before I knew any of these details, and so took no action to mitigate their effects.

## Foe-Reaper 5000

A mechanical harvester.

##### Notes:
* I have no idea what any of his attacks do, but my healers don't seem to have any trouble with the fight.
* At least one of the smaller harvesters in the area is rideable.

##### Questions:
* How is the fight initiated? Is it a timeout after the smaller harvesters are killed? Or does someone have to enter one of the harvesters to trigger the fight?

## Admiral Ripsnarl

A worgen.

##### Notes:
* He disappears from time to time.
* Has non-elite adds, that generally don't need to be tanked.

##### Questions:
* Is threat carried over when he disappears and reappears?

## Captain "Cookie"

A murloc.

##### Notes:
* He just stays in his cauldron. He doesn't move at all. He does not need to be tanked in the usual sense.
* All my groups seem to just burn him down, ignoring his food.
* His "bad" foods have a damage AoE with a small range.
* Eating "bad" food debuffs the player's movement and casting speed.
* Eating "good" food buffs the player's movement and casting speed.

##### Things To Try:
* Eating a "bad" food, followed immediately by a "good" food should both eliminate the "bad" food, and leave the player with the good food buff. This is therefore probably an optimal way to handle this fight.

## Miscellaneous Notes

Some of the pulls of Defias triplets are tricky. If you pull the one in the middle, the two on either side will charge random party members, and have to be picked up. I'm not sure, but seem to remember that charging doesn't get all three. Therefore the best strategy might be to charge either the left or the right, then either heroic throw or taunt the one that charges the party.

The mine bunnies are particularly hard to kill. I've read that they don't need to be pulled, but it might be faster to just pull them and kill them than to wait for them to patrol out of the way.
