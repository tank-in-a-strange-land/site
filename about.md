Tanking notes, UI mods, and the obligatory blog while leveling a protection warrior in World of Warcraft in 2018.

Things I'm trying to evaluate along the way:
* How well do easily purchased strength plate heirlooms perform?
* Which UI modifications help the most, and why?
* Does any of this even matter in 2018?
* Can good tanking practices make runs go more smoothly?
* Do you need to know fight mechanics at all?
* Will I ever learn my way around all these dungeons?
