title: Situational Awareness Checklist
---

## Before The Pull
* Does your healer have sufficient mana for this fight?
* Do you have line-of-sight to your healer?
* If a mob in the pull fears a player, are they likely to pull another group?

## During The Fight
* Keep an eye on the melee, if they're running away, maybe you should too.
* Scan the party's unit frames for aggro.
* Are you standing in fire? Are you forcing the DPS to choose between attacking from behind, or standing in the fire?
* Do you have line-of-sight to your healer?
